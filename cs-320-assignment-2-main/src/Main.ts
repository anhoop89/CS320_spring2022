// This assignment will be very similar to part 2 of assignment 1: we're working
// with a language of arithmetic instead of Boolean logic this time, but the AST
// structure of the language is almost the same as it was in assignment 1.

// We're adding in one brand new feature this time: our AST type has a new kind
// of leaf that represents a *variable name*. This means our arithmetic
// expressions can now contain variable names, and when we interpret an
// arithmetic expression to calculate its value, we'll have to account for any
// names in the expression.

// We're going to start slow with these concepts, so for now our arithmetic
// language does not have any way to create or modify variables within a
// "program"; instead, we set the constant value of each variable **before** the
// interpreter starts running. This is roughly like passing command-line
// arguments to a program.

// Our AST type looks just like our LogicTree type from assignment 1, except
// with an extra case for NameLeaf.

// When we interpret an arithmetic expression that contains variables, how do we
// know what value each variable should have?

// Our interpreter function needs a way to *map* variable names to variable
// values, in this case numbers. In PL terminology, we need a *binding* for each
// variable in our program: a known definition that says what the exact value of
// the variable is.

// A *scope* is fundamentally a collection of variable *bindings*. Scopes can
// get quite complex, but in this assignment we will only have one simple scope
// in our whole program: all of our variables are *global* and *constant*.

// The Map<string, number> type contains a collection of "slots" or "cells",
// each **indexed by** a string and **containing** a number. You don't really
// need to worry about the specifics of how the Map type works - we'll only be
// interacting with it using the lookup function provided below.
export type Scope = Map<string, number>;


// To create a scope, we can use the Map constructor, which takes kind of an odd
// pattern of arguments. You won't need to create any scope values in this
// assignment, but it may be helpful to use this function to inspect them in the
// debugger in order to make sure you understand what a scope value looks like.
export function sampleScope(): Scope {
  // An empty scope can be constructed with the zero-argument Map constructor.
  const scope1 = new Map();

  // A non-empty scope is constructed with the **one-argument** Map constructor,
  // which takes an **array of two-element arrays**. Each inner array represents
  // a single *variable binding* in our arithmetic language. In each inner
  // array, the first element is the name of the variable being defined, and the
  // second element is the value of the variable. This scope defines x = 1 and
  // y = 2; note the outer **and** inner square brackets, which are all
  // necessary.
  const scope2 = new Map([
    ["x", 1], ["y", 2]
  ]);

  // Each variable in a scope has a unique binding: if we try to build a scope
  // with more than one binding for the same variable, only the **last** binding
  // is actually used. In this scope, x = 2, which you can verify on the webpage
  // and in the debugger.
  const scope3 = new Map([
    ["x", 1], ["x", 2], ["y", 3]
  ]);

// Since our expressions can now have variables, they can also have *errors* if
// it turns out that a program contains an undefined variable. For now, we'll
// just throw a TypeScript exception if this happens.

// It's good practice to define a new custom exception type for each different
// kind of exception we plan to throw. The extends keyword is how we do
// subclassing in TypeScript; the Error class is just some built-in magic that
// makes thrown exceptions nicer to debug.
export class ScopeError extends Error { }

// This function is our only interface for using the Scope type, for now. The
// lookup function allows us to access the value of a variable in a scope, and
// throws a ScopeError if the variable does not have a binding in the scope.
export function lookup(name: string, scope: Scope): number {
  // The .get function on the Map<string, number> type takes a string and gives
  // back either a number or a value equal to null. If the variable name has a
  // binding in the scope, we get its number value; otherwise, we get back null.
  const value = scope.get(name);

  // The purpose of this lookup function is to wrap the .get function and throw
  // an exception if it returns null. This is convenient in our interpreter.
  if (value == null)
    throw new ScopeError("name is not in scope: " + name);

  // If the value isn't null, it contains the value of the variable that we

// Here's an example of a transformation over an AST which changes its
// **structure** but doesn't change its **value** when we interpret it.

// As the README mentions, when you input a negative number in one of the
// textboxes on the webpage (like "-1"), it becomes a NegateNode whose subtree
// is a NumLeaf. This is fine in principle, but maybe we want to *simplify* this
// pattern in our trees, so that a negative number is represented as a NumLeaf
// with a negative value field.

// We could make this change in the *parser* of our language, but we'll see that
// concept in a couple weeks; for now, we'll make the change by **transforming**
// an input AST into a modified output copy.

// Note that this function only transforms a single negation operation, so that
// for example "--1" becomes a single NegateNode whose subtree is a negative
// NumLeaf. It may be a good (ungraded) exercise to try to rewrite this function
// so that it also simplifies expressions like "--1" and "---1" to a single
// NumLeaf with no NegateNodes.
